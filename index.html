    <h1 id="title">01.About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi there! I'm Dilip Kumar B and I love creating things that are based on internet. My interest in web development started back in 2020 when I decided to try building my own website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.I am a fourth-year BE student at The Oxford College Of Engineering, pursuing a degree in Information Science. I have always been fascinated by the power of data and how it can be used to solve real-world problems. I have learned various programming languages, such as Python, Java, and C++, and have developed several projects using them.<br>Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:

      Machine Learning Intern  August 2023 - September 2023<br><br>
      
      Worked on a project to develop and deploy a natural language machine learning model that can analyze text data and perform various tasks, such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, text summarization, and text generation
      Used Python, TensorFlow, NLTK, and other libraries and frameworks to preprocess, train, test, and evaluate the model on various datasets
      Implemented various natural language processing techniques, such as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, word embeddings, attention mechanisms, and transformers
      Achieved high accuracy and performance metrics for the model on different domains and languages
      Presented the project results and demo to the company executives and clients.</p>

    <h1>03.Some Things I've Built</h1>
    <p>o E-commerce website (full stack): <br><br>I developed a full-stack e-commerce website that allows users to browse, search, and purchase products online. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end, and PHP, MySQL, and Laravel for the back-end. I implemented features such as user authentication, shopping cart, payment gateway, product reviews, and order tracking. I also used Bootstrap and jQuery to make the website responsive and interactive. You can see a demo of the website at [e-commerce website].<br><br>
      o Music app clone (Android):<br><br> I created a music app clone for Android devices that mimics the functionality and design of a popular music streaming service. I used Java and Android Studio to develop the app, and Firebase to store and retrieve the data. I implemented features such as music playback, playlist creation, song search, offline mode, and user profile. I also used Glide and ExoPlayer libraries to handle image loading and media playback. You can see a video of the app at [music app clone].</p>
